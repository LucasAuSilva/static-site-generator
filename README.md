# Statis Site Generator

It's an generator that get's the markdowns folders in an source directory `fixed to be ./contents for now`,
and creates an html page folowing the provided `template`.

This was an project for the course on [Boot.dev](https://www.boot.dev/) to learn skills in python.

You can check the the generated site in [here](https://lucasausilva.github.io/static-site-generator/) 
And the markdown files used for the generation [here](./content)
